# img_classifier

This is an implementation of Google's machine learning open source platform, *TensorFlow*.

1-import the deep learning library, keras as well as other necessary tensor flow libraries
2 -use one of the built in datasets, cifer10 data set, that has 10 classes of different colored images.
3- load the data and normalize it
4- split it into training and testing sets
5- plot the images using matplotlib
6- Building the model:
the model consists of 3 convolutional layers with max pooling in between followed by linear layers for classification in the end
then compile the model
training the model
plot the results of accuracy
finally evaluate the model on the test data
